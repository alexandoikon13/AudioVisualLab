# AudioVisualLab

## Project Overview
This project presents a web-based application designed for audio processing. It offers users the ability to upload audio files, apply various audio processing techniques, and download the processed output. The application is built with a focus on ease of use, allowing users to effortlessly transform their audio files through an intuitive web interface.

## Key Features
- ##### Audio File Upload: Users can upload audio files directly to the cloud for processing.
- ##### Processing Options: Includes functionalities like crossfading between two audio tracks, smoothing audio edges, and converting audio formats.
- ##### Cloud-Based Storage: Utilizes Cloudcube, an AWS S3-based add-on, for robust and scalable storage of audio files.
- ##### Download Processed Files: Users can download the processed audio files through generated links.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- ##### Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, used to create the web server and handle HTTP requests.
- ##### MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing metadata about the audio files and processing details.
- ##### Cloudcube: An AWS S3-based storage solution integrated into the app for storing audio files, both original and processed.
- ##### Librosa and Soundfile: Python libraries used for audio processing tasks like format conversion, crossfade, and smoothing edges.
- #### Heroku: A cloud platform used to deploy and host the web application, offering seamless integration with GitHub for continuous deployment.

## How It Works
- ####Upload: Users upload an audio file, which is then stored in Cloudcube.
- ####Process: Users select an audio processing action and, if necessary, configure additional parameters.
- ####Storage and Metadata: The processed file is stored back in Cloudcube, and metadata about the processing is saved in MongoDB.
- ####Download: Users receive a link to download the processed audio file.

## Future Scope (ToDOs)
- ####Expanded Audio Processing Features: Plans to include more complex audio processing capabilities.
- ####User Interface Enhancements: Continuous improvements for a more interactive and user-friendly experience.
- ####Performance Optimization: Ongoing efforts to enhance the efficiency and speed of audio processing.
